Multi-antibiotic resistance, occurring when a bacteria becomes tolerant to standard treatment through evolution and selection pressure, is a worldwide problem. An essential component of combating antibiotic resistance requires understanding multiple factors: ecological competition between bacteria, the prevalence and profiles of pre-existing resistance, selection pressure variability due to both varying drug uptake and schedule adherence to prescribed antibiotics, and more. To better model and address these factors in the lab, we looked to advance the in-silico and in-vitro simulations of variable dose uptake and scheduling.

In our work we used the EVE, a small, experimental, raspberry-pi based bioreactor that can pump drugs or nutrients into bacterial culture units. This study focuses on dose scheduling, and we used Python to develop mathematical models antibiotic resistance evolution to form predictions. At the same time, we developed new adaptive EVE algorithms to simulate, in-vitro, different pharmacodynamics and dosing schedules and their adherence. To study the effect dosing regimens have on the evolution of antibiotic resistance, we created three separate control algorithms for the EVE to simulate dosing processes, all of which work to automate dosing processes in a controlled setting. We then experimentally verified our predictions about the effects of different cefotaxime dosing regimens on the co-evolution of combinations of different wildtype and resistant Weinreich E. coli strains in the EVE.
